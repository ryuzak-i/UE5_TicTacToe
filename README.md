# UE5_TicTacToe

## Description
**Unreal Engine 5.4**

Classic tic-tac-toe is a game where the width, height and number of symbols to win are equal to three (i.e. 3-3-3). But there are various modifications for this game, such as changing these three parameters. If you are interested, you can learn more about the [Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) and the [M,n,k-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game).

When you start the game, the main menu of the game opens. The player needs to choose the size of the game grid and the number of symbols to win the game in the `range from 3 to 10`.

During the game, a game grid is displayed in the center of the screen. On the sides of the screen are player panels, which display the `name` of the player (X/O), whose `current turn` and the `number of wins`.

Using the `Esc` key, you can call the pause menu, from which you can return to the main menu.
At the end of each round, the game result is displayed. Player `X` starts the first move in each round.
